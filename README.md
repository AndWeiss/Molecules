# Molecules

It calculates the movement of particles (realized as ellipses), based on an audio input. 

It is programmed with processing version 3+ https://processing.org/download/
Additionally the papaya library, for matrix multiplication must be installed http://adilapapaya.com/papayastatistics/
also the minim library is mandatory.

The Molecules move towards a direction that is calculated by the collision of the molecules to each other. 

Some (physical) parameters change with the sound input. 

The sound input transformed to a fourier space, which is separated into five intervalls. 
Get_sound_numbers will calculate the mean (f_means) and the maximum (f_maxs) values of the magnitude in these intervalls. 
Addidinaly it calculates the magnitude difference to the timely earlyer mean value, and the stereo intensity by comparing left and right audio input.
The calculated sound number are scaled with factors (factors), which can be adjusted with the keyboard.
